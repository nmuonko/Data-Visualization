# Data-Visualization

Data visualization is the visual depiction of data through the use of graphs, plots, and informational graphics. Its practitioners use statistics and data science to convey the meaning behind data in ethical and accurate ways.

# Things I can do after completing this project:

-Provide a stronger foundation in data visualization in Python

-Following a review of basic plotting with Matplotlib, this chapter delves into customizing plots using Matplotlib.
Showcases various techniques for visualizing two-dimensional arrays
Customizing graphics, plotting two-dimensional arrays (e.g., pseudocolor plots, contour plots, images, etc.)
Customizing statistical graphics (e.g., visualizing distributions & regressions)
